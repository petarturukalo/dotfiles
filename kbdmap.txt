KEYBOARD REMAPPINGS

keyboard: vortex pok3r 
mappings:
- capslock = fn
- fn+tab = capslock
- fn+h = arrow left
- fn+j = arrow down
- fn+k = arrow up
- fn+l = arrow right
- fn+0 = home
- fn+4 = end
- fn+f = pgdn
- fn+b = pgup
- fn+g = ctrl+home
- fn+t = ctrl+end
- fn+q = ~
- fn+w = alt+f4
- fn+e = f4
- fn+a = volume down
- fn+s = volume up
- fn+d = ctrl+pgdn
- fn+v = ctrl+pdup
- fn+z = crl+b

All mappings end in fn+t adding a delay of 15 ms so that they don't
repeat when pressed too fast. The downside of this is that if you hold 
the key down it will only repeat every 15 ms.
